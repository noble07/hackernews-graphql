Build with GraphQL and Typescript, using Prisma ORM and Nexus for building the Schemas.

Taken from the [HOW TO GRAPHQL TUTORIAL](https://www.howtographql.com/typescript-apollo/0-introduction/)

The project implements the code-first approach, thanks to [Nexus](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus), insted of the schema-first approach, this brings the features of schema-first plus some great features of code-first like: 

- Expressive, declarative API for building schemas
- Full type-safety for free
- Auto-generated GraphQL SDL (`schema.graphql` file)
- Works out of the box with existing GraphQL frameworks and middleware (`apollo-server`, `graphql-middleware`, etc.)

To learn more about the advanteges of code-first approach over schema-first, please read this interesting [Prima's article](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3) about it.
